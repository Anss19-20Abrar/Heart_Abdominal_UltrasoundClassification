# Heart_Abdominal_UltrasoundClassification
# Medical Imaging Data Science Project

This repository contains the code and data for a data science project focused on medical imaging analysis. The objective of this project is to use machine learning techniques to solve a medical imaging problem using ultrasound images.

## Dataset
The ultrasound images used in this project were collected from the Stanford EchoNet challenge. The dataset consists of two main categories of images:
- **Heart Ultrasounds**: This directory contains a sequence of 218 four-chamber heart ultrasound images of a patientâ€™s heart, each of size 128x128 pixels. The images are split into the following subdirectories:
  - `closed`: Contains 80 images where the Mitral valve appears fully closed, thus clearly splitting LV and LA chambers.
  - `open`: Contains 138 images where the Mitral valve is open or not fully closed.
  - `various`: Contains segmentation masks manually annotated by clinicians, along with a .gif file showing the sequence of images and a .tiff file with the ordered sequence.

- **Abdominal Ultrasounds**: This directory contains 925 images of 128x128 pixel abdominal ultrasounds. These images correspond to the training and testing set of the abdominal ultrasound images from the US simulation & segmentation challenge on Kaggle.

## Experiments
The project is divided into three main experiments, each focusing on different aspects of medical imaging analysis using machine learning techniques:

1. **Experiment 1**: Classification of abdominal ultrasounds and heart ultrasounds.
2. **Experiment 2**: Classification of "open" and "closed" heart ultrasounds.
3. **Experiment 3**: Improvement of classification results using advanced techniques such as image augmentation, attention mechanisms, and transfer learning.
